# Real-time-Colour-Detection
<br>
This project was built to learn the how BGR(Blue, Green, Red) varies from HSV.<br>

```
HSV stands for Hue, Saturation and Value

'Hue' represents the color,
'Saturation' represents the amount to which that respective color is mixed with white and
'Value' represents the amount to which that respective color is mixed with black (Gray level).
```
